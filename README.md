# Assignment One--Creating a Worship Set

In this assignment I will describe/instruct how to create a worship set for church that fits the message and the audience.

## Outline
- Evaluate message being given
- Read through main Bible verses
- Define theme
- Determine audience (elderly, youth, middle age, mix)
- Setting
- Pick musicians (if optional)
- Browse song books/songs that particularly come to mind
- Pick 3-4 songs that fit best considering the above circumstances (keeping in mind time)
- Arrange songs from build-up (slow songs at beginning, more up-beat or impactful songs at end)
- Pick key
- Consider transitions for key changes into new songs
- Practice
- Worship Time!

** Remember its for the kingdom of God and an act of showing love and praise to God, not about your best ability to put on a good show

### Example

- Thanksgiving service about giving thanks with a grateful heart
- various verses throughout bible and christianity as a whole
- Thankfulness and gratefulness 
- Mixed audience
- 8:30 service and 10:45 service; Sunday morning
- Seasoned musicians, middle aged, lead worship most Sundays
- Songs about being grateful/ thankful
( Give Thanks, Forever, Worthy is the Lamb, Thank You Lord, Grateful, Made me Glad, Come Ye Thankful People Come, Who Am I, 10,000 Reasons, I'm Forever Grateful)
- I'm Forever Grateful, Grateful, Forever, Give Thanks
- Give Thanks, I'm Forever Grateful, Forever, Grateful
- Give Thanks (B flat), I'm Forever Grateful (F sharp), Forever (E flat), Grateful (D flat major)
- Transitions worked out musically
- Prayer between "Give Thanks" and "I'm Forever Grateful"
