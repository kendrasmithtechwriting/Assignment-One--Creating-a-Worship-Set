# Assignment One--Creating a Worship Set

## Introduction
Creating a worship set requires critical thinking geared towards end goals. Many times when thinking of creating worship sets, many believe it has to be created by a superiorly musically inclined person. However, this is un-true. While it is beneficial to have a musically inclined person creating a set, its often good to keep in mind that it is more about the message being given through the lyrics of the song than the actual music being made by instruments. As a whole, the audience of worshippers typically do not pay attention to whether or not you are 3/4 time or 4/4, they do try and determine what chord progression you are using, and they certaintly do not particularly care about what key signature you are in. What the audience of worshippers do care about is that they are able to praise God in their act of worship and that the music being led are songs they all can join in on as their act of praise and that the songs are impactful as they worship. 
For example, in an audience of Wee Worshippers (Pre-School-2nd grade), if you sing "The Old Rugged Cross" they are likely to stand there in silence and not understand what the lyrics are saying because it is not an age appropriate song. It will appear that their time of worship was almost meaningless for them. But if you sing "Rise and Shine" in the same audience of Wee Worshippers, the children notice the upbeat rhythm of the song, they catch the simplistic phrases, and the melody becomes stuck in their head. They begin worshipping God in an exciting and jubilant manner because the song was appropriate for the audience. But if you flip the scenario and sing "Rise and Shine" in an audience full of high-schoolers, they are probably reluctant to join in as an act of worhsip. 
## Things to Consider
Below is a list of the steps to take when creating a sucessful worship set:
- Evaluate message being given
- Read through main Bible verses
- Define theme
- Determine audience (elderly, youth, middle age, mix)
- Setting
- Pick musicians (if optional)
- Browse song books/songs that particularly come to mind
- Pick 3-4 songs that fit best considering the above circumstances (keeping in mind time)
- Arrange songs from build-up (slow songs at beginning, more up-beat or impactful songs at end)
- Pick key
- Consider transitions for key changes into new songs
- Practice
- Worship Time!

** Remember its for the kingdom of God and an act of showing love and praise to God, not about your best ability to put on a good show

### Example

- Thanksgiving service about giving thanks with a grateful heart
- various verses throughout bible and christianity as a whole
- Thankfulness and gratefulness 
- Mixed audience
- 8:30 service and 10:45 service; Sunday morning
- Seasoned musicians, middle aged, lead worship most Sundays
- Songs about being grateful/ thankful
( Give Thanks, Forever, Worthy is the Lamb, Thank You Lord, Grateful, Made me Glad, Come Ye Thankful People Come, Who Am I, 10,000 Reasons, I'm Forever Grateful)
- I'm Forever Grateful, Grateful, Forever, Give Thanks
- Give Thanks, I'm Forever Grateful, Forever, Grateful
- Give Thanks (B flat), I'm Forever Grateful (F sharp), Forever (E flat), Grateful (D flat major)
- Transitions worked out musically
- Prayer between "Give Thanks" and "I'm Forever Grateful"
- Practice
- Service

## Now What?
Now that a brief outline has been created for the flow of the set, and we know who are muscicians will be, what songs we will be singing, and what order they will be sung in, we can beginning working out the fine details of the set... the actual music. 

The first song, "Give Thanks" is in 4/4 time. After practicing with the band, it was decided to be played in the key of B flat because it worked best for the vocalist. The first chord progression will be played twice, the first time to invite the audience to stand and sing with us, the second to begin the song. The song will be played traditionally.

The next song, "I'm Forever Grateful" is also in 4/4 time but is played in the key of F sharp. In order to transition into this piece, we will do a prayer time. After the last verse of "Give Thanks", the band will play the last chord progression repeatedly with a continual decrescendo while the lead vocalist transitions into prayer. When the vocalists says "will you bow your head and pray with  me" the band will stop playing (at this point they should be a pianissimo so it should not sound like an abrupt silence). The vocalist will then lead the prayer. After the prayer is completed, the song should be started and played traditionally. 

On the last verse, the transition into the next song, "Forever" will be started. "Forever" is also in 4/4 time and is to be played Reverently at 72 beats. This song will be played in the key of E flat. The first chord will be played twice, one for the vocalist to ask the congregation to sit down, and the next to start the song. Leading up to the chorus, the band should begin to build. Beginning to crescendo, the tempo may increase from 72 to 74 (only slightly, but enough to feel the build because of the power of the chorus). The song should gradually resolve and lead into the last song "Grateful". 

"Grateful" is also in 4/4 time and its tempo should be around 92. You can adjust the tempo based on musical ability or audience preference. Some congregations do not use upbeat songs, depending on the age group and setting. Since this is the final song before the message and the audience is mixed aged groups, 92 is appropriate. It is a moderate tempo, great for this song. This song will be played in D Flat Major. To transition, play an E flat, B flat, C minor, to D flat chords in that order. Then start the chords for "Graetful". It begins with an A/C#.

Do a natural build with the song and then after ending of the last verse the band can decrescendo into a prayer time with a deacon or as the preacher comes to stage. 

Depending on the comfort of songs with the musicians, practice times will vary. Our band always practices on Wednesday nights after service and again on Sunday mornings before the first service so the monitors can be set appropriately. The volume on the microphones can be adjusted accordingly so it reaches a proper balance, and any last minute touches or changes can be worked out before service starts. It also gives one more chance to ensure tuning on guitars are correct in tune, so the harmony is smooth. 

## Service
Feed off your audience! If it appears the audience is losing interest or getting bored, build the music. Increase tempo, add more crescendos, decrescendos, etc. 

If the audience is being heavily impacted by the song, maybe repeat a chorus or keep playing the chord progression near the end to allow for more reflection/prayer time. 

If the audience is older, and they appear to be getting tired or weak from standing, offer for the audience to sit (or stand) as they need or are able to. 

Worship is not about the technicality of the piece, or the ability to play intricatly and precisely, but rather as an act of praise. 

"Let everything that has breath Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord" Psalm 150:6

"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,  who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God" 1 Corinthians 1:3-4
